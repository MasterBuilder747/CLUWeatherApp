# CLUWeatherApp
Android Studio weather application

This was originally a project done by Me, Kyle, Keith, and Blake from CS club.
It is now archived here in its original form, as I forked Kyle's version of the repo.

Since Android development was difficult at the time of this project's creation, 
we decided to allow for Kyle to continue working on it for his android development class.

You can view his progress from the original repository that this was forked from.

So then, this is simply here for the idea of the old project being hosted and organized by me with Git.
